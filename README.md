# Backend Developer Assessment

Hello Jane Smith,

## Overview
In this assignment, you will demonstrate your skills as a Senior Backend Developer using Kotlin. You will be tasked with designing and implementing a RESTful API for a simple task management application. This assignment will assess your ability to create scalable and maintainable backend services.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Task Management API**: 
   - Implement a RESTful API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
   - Each task should have the following attributes: `id`, `title`, `description`, `status`, and `created_at`.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
   - Users should be able to register and log in to access the task management features.

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - Use an in-memory database (like H2) for storing tasks and user information.
   - Ensure that the data persists across application restarts.

## Technical Expectations
- Use Kotlin as the primary programming language.
- Follow RESTful principles for API design.
- Implement proper error handling and validation for API requests.
- Write unit tests for your API endpoints using a testing framework of your choice (e.g., JUnit).
- Document your API endpoints using Swagger or a similar tool.

## Deliverables
- A GitHub repository containing your code.
- A README file with instructions on how to set up and run your application.
- API documentation (Swagger or similar) detailing the endpoints and their usage.

## Time Estimate
You should allocate approximately **10-15 hours** to complete this assignment.

## Submission Instructions
Please submit your completed assignment by pushing your code to the GitHub repository and sharing the link with us. Ensure that your repository is public or provide access if it is private.

## Final Note
This assignment will be reviewed and discussed in your upcoming interview. We look forward to seeing your approach and solutions!

Good luck!
